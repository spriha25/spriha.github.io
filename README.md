This is my resume website.
Started working on this on 5th June 2021.
```This project consists of HTML, CSS, Js and PHP.```

The aim of this project is to deploy my portfolio online and get started on FrontEnd Development as a programmer.
#### Contents
There is an assets folder which has the images, css and other necessary things to deploy the webpage.
The images are copyrighted by me and are private.
Every other icon/ font has been used with credit in the comments from websites like
http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/ and http://fontawesome.io  etc.

This work is not commercial. And it is still work in progress, the contact form needs to be taken care of.
